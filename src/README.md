### Implementation 
The implementation of this project is divided into three main stages:  

1. **Data Processing (`data_processing/`)**  
   - Preparation of the LearningQ dataset to make it usable for question generation.  
   - Includes scripts for downloading videos, filtering data, and structuring the dataset.  

2. **Model (`models/`)**  
   - Code related to the models, enabling automatic question generation.  
   - Includes inference scripts.

3. **Evaluation (`evaluation/`)**  
   - Scripts for assessing question generation performance based on multiple metrics.  
   - Includes both **manual** and **automatic** evaluation approaches.
